        <p>4. A local university has asked you to create an HTML5 document that allows
            prospective students to provide feedback about their campus visit. Your HTML5
            document should contain a form with text fields for name and e-mail address. Provide
            checkboxes that allow prospective students to indicate what they liked most about the
            campus. The checkboxes should include: campus, students, location, atmosphere,
            dorm rooms and sports. Also, provide radio buttons that ask the prospective students
            how they became interested in the university. Options should include: friends,
            television, Internet and other. In addition, provide a text area for additional
            comments, a submit button and a reset button. Use post to send the information in the
            form to http://www.deitel.com. [15 marks]
