        <p>5. Create an HTML5 document that contains an autocomplete search form using a
            search input element in which the user can enter a search query. Add a submit button
            and a reset button. Using Google Chrome, test the form by entering January and
            submitting the form. Then enter J in the input element to see previous entries that
            started with J – January should be displayed below the input element. Enter June and
            submit the form again. Now enter J in the input element to see previous entries that started with J – January and June should be displayed below the input element. Try
            this with your own search queries as well. [10 marks]
